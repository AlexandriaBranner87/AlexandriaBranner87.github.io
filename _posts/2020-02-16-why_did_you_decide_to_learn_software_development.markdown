The reason why I decided to learn software development last summer I ran across an IG page with someone 
speaking about HTML. I thought it seem pretty cool so I paid for some lessons from Codecademy and really had 
fun learning HTML it started off hard because I wasn't getting it but I didn't give up and I stared to understand it and just seeing my code start to work was the best feeling!
